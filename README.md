# Comic Kindle
## A simple comic book app for Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) capstone project.

This project demonstrates the use of [Comic Vine API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/). The purpose is to create a database of comic issues, volumes, and characters then track them using lists. There are two types of lists: My Collection and Watchlist. My Collection allows users to save issues they have already read or own. The Watchlist allows users to watch volumes to track the release dates of new issues.
